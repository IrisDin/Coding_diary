# Infomatics Note

**What is Informatics?**&#x20;

**The science of human-centered information interaction:**&#x20;

• how we create and capture it

&#x20;• how we store, organize, manage, and protect it&#x20;

• how we find it when we need it&#x20;

• how we manipulate it&#x20;

• how we share it&#x20;

• how we get rid of it&#x20;

• how we make it work for people

Analyzing technology understanding and communicating its failings and flaws, so we can identify ways to improve it

Designing technology deciding what software should do (not just how), so that it improves lives, organizations, and society, rather than just having more functionality

**Techno-optimism（科技乐观主义者）**

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">Humans have dominated and can/should shape nature.</mark>

**Techno-pessimism（科技悲观主义者）**&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">social media is incapable of ushering in a social revolution and/or social media hinders positive social change</mark>



**Informatics blends 3 disciplines：**

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**Information**</mark>

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**People**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Technology**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;"></mark>

**Typical Job Roles for INFO：**

&#x20;• IS/Full-Stack Developer&#x20;

• UX/UI Designer&#x20;

• Data Scientist&#x20;

• Information Architect&#x20;

• Security Engineer/Analyst&#x20;

• Systems Analyst&#x20;

• Project/Program Manager



**Information alchemy**： Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom

**information overload**： the state of being overwhelmed by the enormous amount of information encountered each day

**information explosion**： an unprecedented increase in the amount of stored and transmitted data and messages in all media (including electronic, print, radio, and television).

what are the **three principal** uses of the term 'information'?&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Information-as-thing**</mark>

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Information-as-process**</mark>

&#x20;<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Information-as-knowledge**</mark>

**Information-as-thing** w/ example： data in the form of numbers, characters, records, documents, photos, audio, video, or physical objects; these are what we store and manipulate with information technology

* tangible, comes in the form of objects such as data or documents

``

**information-as-process w**/ example the act of being informed by encountering data that has been turned into something meaningful to the person

* describes the method or process of an individual being informed -EX: a person reading an article in the newspaper

``

**information-as-knowledge w**/ example the result of information-as-process; the intangible web of concepts and ideas in your own mind, which you can often externalize again into information-as-thing

* describes the information or knowledge that is communicated in a particular fact, subject, or event; it is intangible
* EX: a person verbally expressing their opinion about a news article to another person



**Information**&#x20;

Information emerges from the contextualized relationship between data and knower.

**Tacit knowledge** the kind of knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it

**Technology** definition：

&#x20;"the study of art or craft"

**Information Technology** definition：

&#x20;the technology (in the broad sense) we use to create, capture, manipulate, protect, and share information in desirable ways

technological determinism technology influences society

* describes how technologies change throughout time, either because of scientific advances or because of basic adaptation
* technologies than have effects on society and how people interact

mutual shaping technology and society mutually shape each other

social determinism society influences technology

**Affordances**（功能可见性）：

ways technology suggests to us that it should be used; when a technology's affordances align with someone's vulnerabilities, unhealthy or addictive behaviors can easily occur

technological domestication new technologies are **"tamed"** as we integrate them into our lives; we as a society have the power to use technology a certain way

fake news content, articles, videos that present made up or false information

relevance importance of a digital document regarding a search query

ranking the process by which a relevant page is pushed to top of your results

**disinformation** false information purposely disseminated, usually by a government, for the purpose of creating a false impression but is still information

* aggregates data, perception, and context into a narrative that helps us understand the world

**Design thinking** definition a human-centered method for creatively solving problems and improving products, processes, or services; a method is just a general approach, not deterministic algorithm for success

* design thinker has a hand in every step of the product design process, not just the end
* uses their sensibility and methods to fulfill people's needs with products that are technologically feasible and efficient

**3 steps to design thinking** (TED video)

understand the end-user&#x20;

understand the root of the problem&#x20;

find a simple, low-cost solution

**3 steps to design thinking** (3 I's)

&#x20;Inspiration,

&#x20;Ideation,

&#x20;Implementation

**Inspiration (Step 1)**&#x20;

• identify an opportunity or problem to solve&#x20;

• figure out who cares and who is affected the most&#x20;

• research and empathize with them to determine what they want/need/value; adjust problem as needed&#x20;

• analyze existing solutions&#x20;

• identify existing infrastructure you can leverage&#x20;

• be realistic about your economic, technical, legal, and cultural constraints

**Ideation (Step 2)**&#x20;

• Try to start with a clean slate; think outside the box with divergent thinking

• then use convergent thinking to narrow it down to a small set of possible solutions&#x20;

• consider the whole system; design an entire platform not just a single product&#x20;

• prototype, test, and fail often!

&#x20;**Implementation（Step 3)**

• Build a development team with complementary skills; every visionary needs an engineer&#x20;

• Develop a feasible business strategy&#x20;

• Release early and often (if practical)&#x20;

• Surround it with a community of supporters and collaborators

&#x20;• Closely monitor reactions/usage, and feed that back into the next cycle



Erika Hall Identify patterns and develop empathy to do user research

User Research can help you avoid No market need, poor product, ignore customers

**ethnography definition (lecture) 人种学**

&#x20;study of what people do and why they do it&#x20;

• observing ordinary life, not in artificial environment (study in their context)&#x20;

• uses qualitative methods to understand and document the activities and mind-sets of a particular product/process user&#x20;

• observed in their ordinary activities and habitual environment

Research methods expert review, diary study, participatory design, usage analysis, A/B testing,

expert review research in journal databases, talking to experts/read their work&#x20;

• an inspection method designed to identify usability problems in an online product or service

&#x20;• usability expert uses his/her knowledge and experience of testing websites with users to walk through a website in the shoes of a typical user

diary study（日记研究） have write down behavior&#x20;

• collects qualitative information by having participants record entries in a log or diary about the activity or experience being studied（记录参与者的行为以日记的形式）

participatory design bring target users into the design process, discover design elements you would've never expected&#x20;

• approach to the assessment, design, and development of technological and organizational systems（大家一起参与设计）

usage analysis instrumentation; how people use the app&#x20;

• any technique for understanding the usage statistics of something

A/B testing different styling to see if you get a different response form users&#x20;

• comparing two versions of a web page to see which one performs better; show the two variants to similar visitors at the same time

User Personas fictitious but representative character profiles • representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users; synthesized from data collected from interviews with users

definition UX Design lecture)

&#x20;the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

* anticipating user's desires and simplifying the experience

interaction design an area of design that focuses on how people interact with artifacts, either through direct physical manipulation, or indirect software-based interfaces; goal is to make things 'intuitive' • user-oriented field of study that focuses on meaningful communication of media through cyclical and collaborative processes between people and technology

**Design Thinking:**

&#x20;Process&#x20;

empathize

define

&#x20;ideate

prototype

test



**affordances (lecture 2)**

功能可见性 relationship; things that a particular user can do with an object

* describe the relationship between the properties of an object and a person

discoverability to be effective, affordances have to be discoverable; when you look at something you should be able to "discover" what operations you can do; you shouldn't need instruction manual or sign to figure it out

**signifier (lecture)符号，象征**

&#x20;indicates that the user can/cannot do something; if signifier does not match the affordance it will not be used correctly

* refer to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to the user

**mapping (lecture)**

&#x20;setting relationship between; a natural correlation between controls and what they control

**feedback (lecture)**&#x20;

communicating the result of a user's action; EX: crosswalk buttons

* result of user's action

**multi-sensory feedback**

&#x20;EX: sound engineers for BMW; to hear the roar of the engine in electric cars

**constraints**&#x20;

design elements that make it difficult or impossible to use a device incorrectly; EX: plug

conventions long established patterns that become learned signifiers or expected mappings; EX: traffic signals

**constraints in UI design**

&#x20;user can't do it all; makes it difficult or impossible to use the device/UI incorrectly; EX: click accept Terms & conditions

**UI postures**&#x20;

UI's postures should match the PLATFORM on which it runs and the context in which it's used • characterizes the nature of a software application's interaction with its user

**platforms**

&#x20;desktop, web, mobile, e-reader, wearable, TV, kiosk, automotive display, smart appliance, augmented/virtual/mixed reality

**contexts**&#x20;

creating/editing content, completing a transaction, browsing/searching, looking up/verifying information, being reminded, adjusting settings, etc.

**postures**&#x20;

sovereign, transient, satellite

&#x20;sovereign posture

&#x20;long, exclusive, rich/complex interactions&#x20;

• monopolizes the user's attention for long periods of time

**transient**

&#x20;quick, interspersed, single-purpose interactions&#x20;

• comes and goes, presenting a single, high-relief function with a tightly restricted set of accompanying goals

satellite simplified interactions as extension of another device



**Skeuomorphism（拟真设计；拟物化；拟物化设计）**

The use of ornamental design cues in digital interfaces that are inherent to the structure and function of the physical object being replaced (i.e. UI that looks and acts like the physical thing it's replacing); EX: iBooks



**Steps to Designing UI:**

1. determine the most common actions, as well as other more advanced actions&#x20;
2. sketch rough primary screens that make common actions intuitive and easy, and secondary screens that make advanced features possible&#x20;
3. ruthlessly follow the design conventions for your target platform&#x20;
4. provide clear signifiers, mapping, and feedback&#x20;
5. prevent mistakes, and enforce unavoidable constraints



**principles that UI designers should strive for:**

1. consistency
2. create interfaces that keep the users in control
3. create a natural sequence of actions and dialogs
4. create interfaces that are applicable and usable by a diverse set of users



**TCP/IP:**

&#x20;transmission control protocol/internet protocol; provides reliable, in-order, end-to-end transmission of data

**Ping（传输时间)?**

can be used to test connectivity to an internet host, returns the round trip time a packet takes to get from your host to there and back

**Demo**&#x20;

can use "traceroute" to see the routers that packets traverse to get from your device to the device you specify

**DNS**&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">domain name service</mark>; most users don't see or use numerical IP addresses often; hierarchical system that includes .com, .org, .net and country . based addresses like .ca or .eu top level domains

**SAAS**&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Software as a Service</mark>; servers behind the scenes that make things work are in the cloud; google apple, office 365

**IAAS**&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Infrastructure as a Service</mark>; allow IT to run infrastructure/serves in the cloud; typically provide compute and storage functionality; amazon AWS, Microsoft azure
